Contribution Guidelines
======================================

Pull requests must be helpful to the project, of good quality, and high effort.

I have created multiple issues you can reference for inspiration on what to contribute, but don't let yourself be tied down. If you think of something else you would like to add, go for it.

**Be sure to tag me as a reviewer when your pull request is ready to be reviewed.**
