# vue-simple-notes

This is a simple note taking application created for Hacktoberfest 2020. List of notes on the left, note editing on the right.

I have completed all of the major features that I plan to work on. Feel free to make _meaningful_ changes as you desire. See the issues tab for inspiration, or you can come up with your own ideas.

You can now find a hosted version of this project at http://vue-simple-notes.surge.sh
